#1 - Description of project domain
The project we’ve chosen is a Book Trading Hub, an online platform where users can list their personal books and borrow books from other users. The core idea behind this project is to create a community-driven platform where users can share their reading resources, enabling a sustainable and cost-effective way to access books. In today’s digital age, while e-books are widely available, physical books still hold immense value for many readers who prefer the tangible experience of reading. However, purchasing new books regularly can be costly, and borrowing from libraries or friends is often inconvenient due to limited availability or geographical constraints.
This platform addresses both of these issues by allowing users to trade books in a decentralized way, without the need for a central library. The concept leverages the idea of resource-sharing while providing book enthusiasts an opportunity to discover new titles and genres. It also builds a community of readers who interact over shared interests, fostering a more engaged reading culture. We chose this project because it aligns well with the team’s interest in creating a socially impactful application and presents technical challenges such as user management, secure data handling, and a well-designed frontend-backend interaction, all of which are critical in modern software development.
